# COVID-19: Airline Industry Analysis
### I have conducted an analysis on the performance of air line industry affected by global pandemic, covid-19. This includes:
* Total Aircraft Arrivals and Departures Annually 
* Total Passengers Annually
* Net profit of commercial airlines worldwide (in billion U.S. dollars) 
***

## Analysis Summary
After reviewing the datasets, the airline industry is on a downward trajectory with a downturn in passenger traffic, aircraft arrivals, aircraft departures and substantial net losses. As reported in the news report, by the end of May 2020, most of the world's airlines will be bankrupt and will not be operational.

The recovery of the airline industry also depends heavily on the rapid eradication of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government of each country can only continue to enforce a travel ban if the situation does not change. If this continues, it is just a matter of time to bring down the airline industry.
